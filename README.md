On our application 'reactParty' the user can search for different drinks, save your favorit drinks, litsen and control to your Spotify playlists and get some great ideas for some possible icebreakers to cick off the night. 
    

## Why React?
    Before choosing React to work with we looked into both Vue and Angular. We did not choose Vue due to fact that we tought that it was slim on online documentation and examples. Angular was a little more attractive to us, but due to our time limit we felt that it was a bit too complicated to understand and learn. React was therefor the better fit for us, the project and our previous coding knowlegde.
